Meeting Notes: https://www.notion.so/acme/Sprint-Planning-2025-01-08

# Thoughts

* RBAC implementation looks solid overall
* Alice has done great work on the permission system
* Integration tests caught a few edge cases - good investment of time
* Need to start thinking about rate limiting strategy for next sprint

```go
// Example permission check optimization
func (s *Service) HasPermission(ctx context.Context, userID, resource, action string) (bool, error) {
    // Check cache first
    cacheKey := fmt.Sprintf("perm:%s:%s:%s", userID, resource, action)
    if cached, ok := s.cache.Get(cacheKey); ok {
        return cached.(bool), nil
    }

    // Fetch from database if not cached
    result, err := s.repo.CheckPermission(ctx, userID, resource, action)
    if err != nil {
        return false, err
    }

    // Cache for 5 minutes
    s.cache.Set(cacheKey, result, 5*time.Minute)
    return result, nil
}
```
