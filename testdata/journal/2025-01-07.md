## Architecture Review

### Attendees
* [[alice-smith]]
* [[bob-jones]]
* [[carol-white]]
* [[alex-rivera]]

### Notes
* Reviewed authentication architecture
* Discussed security implications of token storage
* Decided to implement short-lived access tokens (15 min) with refresh tokens (7 days)
* Action items:
  * [ ] Update security documentation
  * [ ] Implement token cleanup job
  * [ ] Add monitoring for token usage patterns

Discussion on staging environment setup and deployment strategy

# Thoughts

* Refresh token rotation adds complexity but significantly improves security
* Need to document the token lifecycle clearly for other developers
