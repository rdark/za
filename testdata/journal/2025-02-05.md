- [x] Finalize audit logging design

# Work Completed

* Finalized audit logging design document
  * Event schema defined
  * Storage strategy: PostgreSQL for queryable data, S3 for long-term archive
  * Identified 15 key events to audit initially
  * Retention: 90 days in DB, 7 years in S3
* Started audit logging implementation with [[eve-williams]]
  * Created audit service package
  * Implemented event capture middleware
  * Set up PostgreSQL tables
  * About 30% complete
* Performance testing of existing auth service
  * Baseline metrics before adding audit logging
  * Verified no performance degradation from rate limiting

# Worked On

* Testing audit event capture without impacting request latency
  * Using async event queue to avoid blocking requests
  * Buffered writes to database
  * Need to handle queue overflow scenarios

# Meetings

## Pairing with Eve

Great session working through audit logging implementation together. Eve has excellent ideas for event schema design.

## Team Standup

Updates on audit logging progress. On track for sprint goals.

# Thoughts

* Pairing with Eve was productive - good working dynamic
* Async event processing is the right approach for performance
* Need to think about audit log querying UX
* May want to add Elasticsearch for better search
