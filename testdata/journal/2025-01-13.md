## Goals of the Week

* [ ] Production deployment of auth service
* [ ] Start rate limiting implementation
* [ ] Audit logging design
* [ ] Knowledge sharing session on auth architecture

## Goals of the Day

* [ ] Production deployment of auth service
* [ ] Monitor deployment closely
* [ ] Prepare for potential rollback

# Work Completed

* **Successfully deployed auth service to production!** ðŸš€
  * Executed deployment checklist
  * Zero downtime deployment
  * All health checks passing
  * Monitoring dashboards active
* Monitored production deployment for first 4 hours
  * All metrics within expected ranges
  * No error spikes detected
  * User authentication working smoothly
  * Average response time: 38ms (better than staging!)
* Responded to minor issue with token caching
  * Cache was too aggressive, causing stale tokens
  * Hot fix deployed: reduced cache TTL from 5min to 2min
  * Issue resolved without user impact

# Worked On

* Documentation updates based on production deployment
  * Updated runbook with actual deployment experience
  * Added troubleshooting section for common issues
  * Documented the token caching issue and resolution

# Meetings

## Team Standup

### Notes
* Discussed production deployment success
* Minor cache issue resolved quickly
* Team celebrating successful delivery!
* Starting rate limiting work this week

## [[alice-smith]] Pairing Session

* Paired with Alice on rate limiting design
* Discussed token bucket vs leaky bucket algorithms
* Decided on token bucket for simplicity
* Will use Redis for distributed rate limiting state
* Action items:
  * [ ] Create design doc for rate limiting
  * [ ] Set up Redis cluster for rate limiting
  * [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware

# Calendar

**9:00 AM - Team Standup**

# Thoughts

* Production deployment went much smoother than expected
* Having detailed runbook and checklist was crucial
* Cache issue was good learning - need better cache invalidation strategy
* Team has built something solid - proud of the work

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Monitoring from day one is essential
2. Start with conservative cache TTLs
3. Have rollback plan ready (even if you don't need it)
4. Communication with stakeholders during deployment critical

```yaml
# Rate limiting configuration idea
rate_limiting:
  enabled: true
  backend: redis
  rules:
    - endpoint: /oauth/token
      limit: 10
      window: 60s
      burst: 20
    - endpoint: /api/*
      limit: 100
      window: 60s
      burst: 150
```
