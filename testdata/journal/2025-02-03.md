## 1:1 with Alice

* Handled production issues smoothly
* Team appreciated having clear ownership
* Discussed transition back and my focus areas

# Thoughts

* Vacation was fantastic - completely disconnected
* Team did excellent work without me - great to see
* Slightly overwhelmed by backlog but manageable
* Excited to dive into audit logging work
* Rate limiting implementation looks solid

> **Reflection**: Taking time off is important. Team is fully capable and stepped up. Good reminder that projects don't depend on any single person.
