## Goals of the Week

* [x] Production deployment of auth service
* [ ] Start rate limiting implementation
* [ ] Audit logging design
* [ ] Knowledge sharing session on auth architecture

## Goals of the Day

* [ ] Create rate limiting design document
* [ ] Set up Redis cluster
* [ ] Begin rate limiting middleware implementation

# Work Completed

* Created comprehensive rate limiting design document
  * Compared token bucket vs leaky bucket algorithms
  * Selected token bucket for implementation
  * Defined rate limit tiers for different endpoints
  * Documented Redis data structures
  * Security considerations for rate limit bypasses
* Set up Redis cluster for distributed rate limiting
  * 3-node cluster with replication
  * Configured for high availability
  * Set up monitoring and alerting
  * Tested failover scenarios
* Started implementation of rate limiting middleware
  * Created Go middleware package
  * Implemented token bucket algorithm
  * Added Redis integration
  * Work in progress: ~60% complete

# Worked On

* Testing rate limiting behavior under load
  * Need to verify distributed counting works correctly
  * Testing edge cases around rate limit boundaries
  * Ensuring fair distribution across instances

# Meetings

## Team Standup

Celebrating yesterday's successful deployment. Starting rate limiting work.

# Thoughts

* Redis cluster setup easier than expected
* Token bucket algorithm straightforward to implement
* Need to think carefully about rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-*)
* Should we allow rate limit overrides for premium users?
